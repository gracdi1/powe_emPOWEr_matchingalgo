## Powe Shadow Days Mentorship Matching Algorithm

# IMPORTANT the webpage does not work perfectly so instead do this:

    Pull this repo into your own machine
    Open the file named "ogcode.py"
    Upload your two mentor and mentee spreadsheets to the repo, at the same level as ogcode.py
    Run ogcode.py
    
  It should not take long to process unless there are errors, but in the perfect ending, you should see a spreasheet called "mentor-mentee matching" generated right into the repo

  I recommend using Pycharm or VSCode for your IDE, but anything you are familiar with should work too!

Instructions on how to structure the spreadsheets are details on the webpage and below:

   The algorithm looks for specific keywords in the spreadsheet to perform matches.

   Below is a list of the field specifications you need to ask in the form:

      You need to get the mentor and mentee's name using "Name (First, Last)"

      To find their field of interest you have to ask what "Major" they are looking for

      You also have to use "Language" to find which one they are most comfortable with

      And don't forget to get their email addresses!
